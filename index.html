		<h3>Nicolo</h3>
		<p>Hi! I am Nicolo Jireh D. Unson! </p>
		<h3>"Jai"</h3>
		<P>My nickname came from my second name "Jireh" but I think we spelled it like "jai" because "ji" didn't look good</P>

		<h3>Favorite Computer Science Subject</h3>
		<p>I enjoyed taking CMSC 22 because the object oriented paradigm is very interesting for me. I also enjoyed all the exercises and the project.</p>

		<h3>Favorite Programming Language</h3>
		<p>Having enjoyed CMSC 22 I have grown to like Java. I like it because it is the first OOP language I have used.
		
		<h3>Favorite Food</h3>
		<p>I cannot think of any particular food that I think is my favorite, I enjoy eating meat dishes. There are a few vegetables that I dislike eating like the okra and ampalaya I dislike the texture of okra it is too slimey for me and the ampalaya is just too bitter.</p>

		<h3>Favorite GE</h3>
		<p>I still remember clearly of the time when I took NASC6 it was my second semester in the university. We had very lively lectures and interactive activities. For the final output we had to make a dish which would be featured in the food festival at the end of the sem. We made a paella overnight which was not a good idea.</p>
